# Chat Server and Client Implementation

This is a simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages.

## How to Run

1. First, start the server:
   python mychatserver.py
2. Then, start as many client instances as you want in separate terminals:
   python mychatclient.py
3. Type messages in any client, and they will be broadcast to all other connected clients.
4. To exit a client, type "exit".
